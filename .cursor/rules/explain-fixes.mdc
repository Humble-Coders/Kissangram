# Explain Errors and Fixes

Whenever you fix a compiler or linter error, **always** add a very brief explanation so the user can learn. Keep it:

- **Very brief** (2–4 sentences)
- **Layman-friendly but technical** (no jargon without a one-line plain-English meaning)
- **Clear** (what was wrong, what we changed, why it works)

## Format

1. **What was wrong**: One sentence on what the error meant (e.g. "Swift thought this closure returned nothing").
2. **What we did**: One sentence on the concrete change (e.g. "We added an explicit `return` before the View").
3. **Why it works**: One short sentence on why that fixes it (e.g. "So the compiler knows the closure returns a View, not `()`").

Do this after **each** error you fix in the same response, so the user can learn from every fix.
